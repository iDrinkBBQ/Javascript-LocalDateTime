# Javascript's Date Object Sucks

And I don't think thats something a lot of people will disagree on.


Unfortunately, vanilla Javascript never picked up on a newer, better date-time object that is more programmer friendly and has better features. So, I decided to do something about it.


And since, in my opinion, Java has done date-times right, I decided, why not make it in Javascript since JS's vanilla Dates suck so bad?


## Introducing JS LocalDateTime

Featuring the majority of LocalDateTime operations, this vanilla JS class mimics it's form and operation to make working with dates less dreadful for developers. 


## NOTE

This class does not behave exactly like Java LocalDateTime, and while it is intended to be as similar as possible, it is not perfect. I am not that experienced of a programmer.
